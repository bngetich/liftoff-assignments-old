## Assignment Description
[Project Outline Assignment](https://education.launchcode.org/liftoff/modules/assignments/project-outline)

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
In my home country there has been a shift from subsistence to agribusiness farming. I want to create an app that will help farmers manage their greenhouses. The application will collect sensor data(temperature, humidity, soil moisture ) and send it to ThingSpeak cloud for storage and analysis. It will notify the farmer of any environmental factors that will destroy their crops.
A Rasberry Pi or Arduino can be used to collect the sensor data and send it to ThingSpeak but for the moment I will be sending http requests with mock sensor data to ThingSpeak instead. I will then create a web client that will get the data from the ThingSpeak and visualize it. Once I have the data I can write an algorithm that will notify the farmer(could be via SMS) on the environmental condition.
### Features
1. User Login: User will be able login and view a dashboard of sensor data of their greenhouse
2. Notification: User can receive a notification of any environmental factor that can affect their crop
3. Reactive interface: User will be able to view charts that are dynamic and modern 
### Technologies
<<<<<<< HEAD
1. Spring Boot
2. Angular
3. Jhipster

### What I'll Have to Learn
I would like to learn reactive programming using spring webflux and also how to send and receive data through REST APIs. I also want to get a brief understanding of Internet Of Things(IoT) using Rasberry Pi or Arduino. I will also use this project to learn Jhipster.
