## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I would like to build clinic management web app that help my dad to manage his patients. Currently the system in use is a desktop application and has no internet access. The only way my dad can know how many patients are in queue is to call the front desk. It is also of great importance if he can access some historical information(previous observation, prescribed drugs etc) of a patient. The app will also send email notification whenever a patient is scheduled.
### Features
1. User login
2. Send email through an API?
3. Form entry for patient observations including prescribed drugs
4. Search patients
### Technologies
1. Spring boot
2. Angular
3. JHipster
4. MongoDB

### What I'll Have to Learn
I hope to use this project to learn JHipster. I would also like to learn reactive programming using spring webflux and also how to use data from some APIs e.g an API for fetching a library of drugs.

### Project Tracker
I will use GitHub Projects.
